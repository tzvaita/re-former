## Instructions

1. Copy either one of the two cloning options in the repo

2. Open a terminal in the directory you want to house this project.

3. run git clone (paste the copied text)

4. run bundle install to set up the projects environment on your local machine.

5. To view the project in a browser run rails server in the terminal and visit http:localhost:3000 in your browser.
